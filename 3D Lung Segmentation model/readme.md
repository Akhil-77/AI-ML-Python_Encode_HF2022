# 3D Lung Segmentation Model
This is a Python3 based project where i have implemented a resnet insipred model to create 3D lung mask from CT scans.

To install the requirements use the following command:
pip/pip3 install -r requirements.txt


Details:
Using different deep learning approaches, 
mean Dice similarity coefficients (DSCs) on test datasets varied not over 0.02. 
When trained on a diverse routine dataset (n = 36), a standard approach (U-net) yields a higher DSC (0.97 ± 0.05) 
compared to training on public datasets such as the Lung Tissue Research Consortium (0.94 ± 0.13, p = 0.024) or 
Anatomy 3 (0.92 ± 0.15, p = 0.001). 

Trained on routine data (n = 231) covering multiple diseases, 
U-net compared to reference methods yields a DSC of 0.98 ± 0.03 versus 0.94 ± 0.12 (p = 0.024).
